    <h3>Background</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><mark> As a team of 3, we produced a Augmented Reality App </mark> </li>
        <li> I implemented the logic behind the real-world distance monitoring </li>
        <li> It was a fun project, where I and everyone on the team wanted to simply tinker with Google's experimental AR Browsers </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>How the App Works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is an Augmented Reality Game where the objective is to collect coins</li>
        <li>Coins are collected by tapping on boxes; these boxes are randomly generated at the start</li>
        <li>By getting physically close enough to a box, and then tapping the box on the phone screen, users can collect coins, and increase their score</li>
        <li> Boxes that have already been touched (and gave out coins) turn from orange to red</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>The Techonology</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This uses Google's AR Browsers (not in production and are experimental), which expose functionality of ARCore and ARKit to the web: learn more <a href="https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore">here</a>  </li>
        <li>It's essentially a Chromium modification for Android Apps - the WebARonARCore is built on top of Android ARCore APK </li>
        <li>We use this in conjunction with Three.ar.js (used for developing 3D objects) - docs for Three.ar.js are <a href="https://threejs.org/">here</a> </li>

    <h4>The App in Action</h4>

    <h3>Under the Hood </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In our code, we setup the three.js rendering environment</li>
        <li>Inside the render loop, called once per frame, we constantly check for collisions, by iterating through all the different cubes (which are in a group) and seeing if the camera is close enough to trigger an event </li>
        <li>Boxes (or cubes) are randomly generated around the camera's 3D position </li>      
    </ul><br>
